Good Morning, my name is Ted Kim. I grew up in Seoul and Los Angeles, surrounded by design. My father was an ID professor and from an early age, I crafted my methods of observation. My first design was for my mother, who had physical limitations. When I was 15, I created a hybrid hair dryer/ vacuum that worked for both beauty and utility. I will never forget her smile when I won my first award for design.<br>
<br>

I am constantly thinking of ways to create better solutions with everything I touch. Often the most impactful solutions are derived from the smallest detail, the obscure to the mundane and everything in-between. Understanding the smallest details allows me to conceptualize opportunities and craft a better experience. I am passionate about finding solutions that are human-centered and accessible to all. I want to design a better life, create a smile.<br>
